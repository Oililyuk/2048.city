                <h2>What is 2048?</h2>
                <p>2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, you can keep playing after reaching 2048 to achieve higher scores!</p>

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the arrow keys (or swipe on mobile devices) to move all tiles in that direction.</li>
                    <li>When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.</li>
                    <li>After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty spot.</li>
                    <li>The game ends when you can't make any more moves (the board is full and no tiles can be merged).</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Tips & Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep your highest number in a corner:</strong> This strategy helps maintain order and prevents the highest number from getting in the way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build a descending sequence:</strong> Arrange your tiles in descending order from the corner to make merging easier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't spread out:</strong> Keep your tiles together to maximize merging opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Think about where your next move will lead and how it will affect future moves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the "snake" pattern:</strong> Try to arrange your tiles in a snake-like pattern from the corner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens when I reach 2048?</div>
                    <p>Congratulations! You've won the game. However, you can continue playing to achieve a higher score. The game only ends when you can't make any more moves.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What's the highest possible tile?</div>
                    <p>Theoretically, there's no limit to how high you can go. The highest tile achieved by players is 131,072, but this is extremely rare. Most players aim for 2048 or 4096.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How is the score calculated?</div>
                    <p>Your score increases by the value of the new tile created when you merge two tiles. For example, merging two 4 tiles to make an 8 tile adds 8 points to your score.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What's the best strategy for beginners?</div>
                    <p>Start by keeping your highest number in a corner and build a descending sequence from there. Focus on maintaining order and avoiding spreading your tiles across the board.</p>
